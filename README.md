# Covid Data Exploration

This Covid Project emphasises SQL abilities through data exploration and analysis. The project focuses on the global effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and contains information such as death tolls, infection rates, vaccination rates, and other related indicators.

The following actions were taken:

1- Collected data from the official "Our World in Data" website.

2- Loaded the data into SQL.

3- Investigated data to determine trends and patterns.

4- Uploaded code to GitHub for sharing.

 The project demonstrates how to efficiently utilise SQL to analyse data, and I hope that it will be beneficial to others who are interested in understanding the pandemic's impact.
